title: Fixing Up the Dirty Bird

In the first half of 2024, three things happened:

1. I quit my job at Glowforge. Nine years was plenty, and I am so proud of everything we built there!
2. I got a puppy. Her name is Iggy. She is the [goodest.dog](http://goodest.dog).
3. My friend Wes asked me to maintain his family's sailboat.

This is the story of how Iggy became a boat dog, and I learned a lot about marine diesel engines. I wanted to write this up because there are some fun lessons in here, I figure I should document the experience in case other people have a similar problem, and because it's fun to watch Iggy grow up in the photos. 

*Spoiler: the engine's damper plate was broken– a somewhat common problem for this kind of engine at this age.*

In early March, Wes gave me a rundown of the boat. Here's Iggy with Wes on the dock, trying out the life jacket he had on board for their dog. It just fits her as a puppy.

The Dirty Bird is a [1984 Catalina 30](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/catalina-30/). It's in good shape for a forty year old boat! Wes and his family had also outfitted it really nicely– every time I looked for something it was likely to already be on board. But there were already plenty of things that I was planning to improve on it– and Wes was all about it.

We took the boat out once before Wes and his family moved away, and also hung out on it with some friends at the dock. When we did the first cruise, it seemed to me that the engine was running pretty weakly. It sounded good, but we weren't getting much propulsion.

Perhaps somewhat presciently, I started taking photos. Here's Wes showing me how to access the engine. Just in case.

### "You mean that thing that's famously hard to maintain?"

Naturally, the first time I took the boat out without Wes at the beginning of April, something broke. The engine started up and ran, but when putting it in gear we didn't move. Fortunately we didn't make it out of the marina, and some nice person wandering within earshot was able to catch a line and pull us back to dock after we'd drifted away.

This started a long process of diagnosing and fixing the boat engine. What fun!

In times like these, I always think of my friend Rachael Ludwick's mantra: [Check the obvious things](https://community.glowforge.com/t/check-the-obvious-things-sign/1356). Here's what I checked first:

1. Is the transmission fully in gear?
  * Looks like it. I can feel it engaging at the helm, and I can see the shift lever turning. The cable is tight and moving the shift lever as expected.
2. Does the propeller appear fouled? 
  * Nope. I can turn the prop shaft by hand with the engine off.
3. Is something wrong with the engine?
  * Not that I can tell. The belts in the front are turning fine, things sound good...

So that's... good. At least we're unlikely to need to get into the water or deal with a major engine problem. Wes and I did some phone debugging, asked around on sailboat forums, and came up with one more thing to try:

* Does the transmission fluid need replacing?
  * I swapped the fluid several times. Came out looking clean and not dirty. No change in result.

### Now what?

At this point we were in contact with a marine diesel mechanic, but had not yet scheduled a repair. Turns out as you head into summer these guys get busy. It looked like we might have to wait a while. I thought maybe we could make some headway by getting things ready– maybe we can slip into some early availability if I do most of the pre-work.

I also decided now was a good time to start asking friends for a hand occasionally. My friend Ian helped remove the whole kitchen so we could get at the engine. Suddenly everything was much more visible. Iggy was ecstatic!

Excited to move forward, I emailed the mechanic just in case this would help speed things along. 

Fat chance! Not only did it *not* help, but they wouldn't have availability for us until June! And their estimate was $5,000!

I want to sail this boat this summer. 

I have nothing else to do at the moment. 

Wes is on board to pay for parts and tools.

I guess I'm going to learn how to be a marine engine mechanic.

## The Fun Begins

At this point we started consulting some old salts on sailboat forums. They seemed to think the issue was the damper plate. This is a part which completes the connection between the engine's main flywheel (the power output) and the transmission input shaft. Apparently this damper plate can break if the springs wear out– and in fact it's designed to do so to prevent damage to the more expensive parts. That seems to make sense to me based on what we'd tried so far.

In the below diagram from the [engine's parts list](https://www.westerbeke.com/parts%20manual/200142_m25_m25xp_parts_list.pdf) (page 56 in the PDF) the damper plate is component 13.

![Bell housing group diagram](bell-housing-group.png)

However, accessing the damper plate requires separating the bell housing (6) from the engine body. The space inside the engine hold is tight, and the transmission itself is bolted onto the bell housing *from the inside*. You can't remove the transmission first to make taking the bell housing off easier.

This means we'll need to lift the engine up enough to clear the door of the engine hold so we can remove the bell housing. That was maybe a 6 inch lift.

My friend Brendon and I first tried a simple solution to lifting the engine: Deflate a rubber fender, jam it underneath, and re-inflate. This definitely moved the engine up, but not enough!

Throughout this project I had help from many different friends– so much so that everyone only came by once each! Thanks to Wes, Doug, Ian, Brendon, Jared, Nick, Elijah, and Chris for their help diagnosing and wrenching. We had a lot of fun doing this, and I (sort of) look forward to the next project.
