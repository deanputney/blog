In the first few months of 2024, three interesting things happened:

1. I quit my job at Glowforge. Nine years was plenty, and I am so proud of everything we built there!
2. I got a puppy. Her name is Iggy. You can see more of her at [goodest.dog](http://goodest.dog).
3. My friend Wes asked me to maintain his family's sailboat.

This is the story of how I became a diesel engine mechanic, and Iggy became a boat dog.
