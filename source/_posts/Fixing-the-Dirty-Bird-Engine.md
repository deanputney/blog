In the first half of 2024, three things happened:

1. I quit my job at Glowforge. Nine years was plenty, and I am so proud of everything we built there!
2. I got a puppy. Her name is Iggy. You can see more of her at [goodest.dog](http://goodest.dog).
3. My friend Wes asked me to maintain his family's sailboat.

This is the story of how I learned a lot about diesel engines, and Iggy became a boat dog.

In early March, Wes gave me a rundown of the boat. Here's Iggy with Wes on the dock, trying out the life jacket he had on board for their dog. It just fits her as a puppy.

The Dirty Bird is a [1984 Catalina 30](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/catalina-30/). It's in good shape for a forty year old boat! Wes and his family had also outfitted it really nicely– every time I looked for something it was likely to already be on board. But there were already plenty of things that I was planning to improve on it– and Wes was all about it.

We took the boat out once before Wes and his family moved away, and also hung out on it with some friends at the dock. When we did the first cruise, it seemed to me that the engine was running pretty weakly. It sounded good, but we weren't getting much propulsion.

Perhaps somewhat presciently, I started taking photos. Here's Wes showing me where the engine sits. Just in case.
